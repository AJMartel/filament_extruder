<h1>MOST Filament Extruder V4.1</h1>

The MOST filament extruder for making your own filament.

<a href="https://github.com/mtu-most/most-scad-libraries">MOST SCAD libraries</a> are required if the SCAD files are used. Put all SCAD files in the same directory. The renderer provides a relatively easy way to render the parts while still allowing the extruder library to be used in other designs.

Models of all the printed parts are available in the models/stl directory and pictures of the printed parts may be found in models/rendering.

Development of the electronics was done with Kicad and all source is available in the aptly named kicad directory. Gerbers are there, too.
